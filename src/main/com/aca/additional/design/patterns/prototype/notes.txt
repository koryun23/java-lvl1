The intent of the prototype design pattern is to specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance,
and create new objects by copying this prototype.


The Prototype design pattern provides a solution:
Define a Prototype object that returns a copy of itself.
Create new objects by copying a Prototype object.
